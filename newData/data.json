BitDAO aims to assist those who are working to create a decentralised economy. It's a public platform where BIT token holders can vote on proposals. It is unconcerned about chains or projects. Direct partnerships or swaps with project expansion via specialised autonomous entities such as ecosystem funds, artist guilds, farming cooperatives, R&D Labs, and so on are examples of possible proposals. Peter Thiel, Founders Fund, Pantera, Dragonfly, Spartan, Bybit, and others have all backed BitDAO. Our mission statements are to support decentralised economy builders and to demonstrate the potential of DAOs. To encourage a diverse range of ideas and to test a wide range of economic alignment, governance, treasury management, and organisational options. Our Core Values With fractal expansion, become the largest decentralised autonomous network of entities. Create and collaborate with specialised autonomous entities for ecosystem funds, art, farming, research and development, venture capital, events, grants, education, and DAO operations services, among other things. Encourage autonomous entities to create and collaborate with other autonomous entities, allowing for fractal growth. Collaboration with existing projects is possible through token swaps and other means. Find ways to avoid the top-level BitDAO governance process bottlenecking micro-decisions. BitDAO governance should be limited to mandate and funding approval. Allow your partners to be self-sufficient. R&D, liquidity, funding, and operational support are all used to help partners become category leaders. Attract potential builders by aligning incentives. Make it as simple as possible to create and operate autonomous entities. Concentrate on executing ideas quickly. Encourage a lot of trial and error with temporary solutions based on policy, trust, and risk management mechanics. Iterate on a long-term solution that includes governance and treasury management technology. Find a way to link the BIT value to the entire ecosystem. Treat proposals as synergistic, but also as a bargaining opportunity.",

Nobody will know ahead of time, which is part of the pleasure. Klibansky, a well-known modern artist, created all 6751 items in the collection. The pieces are initially distributed to participants who have contributed research to the discussion, with around 83 percent of the overall supply going to them. A few pieces were also set aside for renowned NFT collectors, with the remainder going to governance. Initially, there were over a thousand holders, thanks to the community's three-year formation.",
